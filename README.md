# ATP Performance Dashboard

This project explores ATP tennis data to generate insights into player performance using **SAS** for analysis and **Power BI** for visualization.
There were three Null Hypotheses to be tested
## Hypothesis 1:
### - Players heights have no impact the number of aces achieved

## Hypothesis 2:
### - Match length does not differ across different tournaments

## Hypothesis 3:
### - Player handedness does not impact number of aces achieved

## Repository Contents
- **/docs** – Project write-up (placeholder; final Word document to be uploaded once available)
- **/code** – SAS analysis code (placeholder; final `.sas` file will be uploaded when available)
- **/dashboard** – Power BI dashboard (PBIX placeholder; this will be uploaded when available)
- **/images** – Dashboard screenshots when available
- **/data** – Dataset information and links

## Dataset
- **Source:** [ATP Tennis Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guillemservera/tennis)  
- **License/Terms:** Public dataset hosted on Kaggle  
- **How obtained:** Downloaded on 02/07/2025

## How to Run
- Once the required datasets have been downloaded (In this case, data from 2014-2024), run the SAS code highlighted in the SAS folder. No cleansing required at this stage, but do confirm datasets match each other.
- Consolidation of datasets was carried out in Excel but this can be done in SAS too (not in the code provided)
 
### SAS
- In this section I will include the SAS code used to cleanse, transform, and analyse the data. This is not currently available due to IT restrictions.

### Power BI
- In this section I will include the PBI dashboard used to display the findings. This is not currently available due to IT restrictions.

## Results / Highlights
### Hypothesis 1 - Players heights have no impact the number of aces achieved
### REJECT THE NULL
(r=0.486, p < 0.0001)

### Hypothesis 2 - Match length does not differ across different tournaments
### REJECT THE NULL
(F=3.23, p < 0.0001)

### Hypothesis 3 - Player handedness does not impact number of aces achieved 
### REJECT THE NULL
(p = 0.0009)
